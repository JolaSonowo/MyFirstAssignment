<br>
<br>
        <blockquote>
          What is Apple, after all? Apple is about people who think <i>‘outside the box’</i> people who want to use computers to help them change the world, to help them create things that make a difference, and not just to get a job done.

    <br>
    <br>
Apple has had a lot of failures in the past, bit an interesting one occured in <del>2016</del>  <ins> 2017</ins>.
<br>
<br>
Following reports of older iPhones becoming unusually sluggish, Apple admitted it was slowing down older iPhones to conserve battery life.
<br>
<br>
 iPhone owners were displeased to learn that Apple had made that decision without their knowledge and consent.
 <br>
 <br>
  As a way to make good, Apple offers to replace affected batteries for $29.99, swapping in 11 million new batteries by the end of 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Along with iPhone batteries, Apple has had, over time, to deal with scattered reports of <strong>exploding batteries</strong> in MacBooks and Powerbooks.
